Building new APIs preferably using API spec

Exercise interview:
provided an existing API solution (no HTML) with a PHP class and asked to:
Review the class and modernise the implementation.
Make the class more testable.
Extend the class with additional functionality.
Write tests for the improved class using PHPUnit. (already installed)
The exercise involves running the code and tests from the command line.
 Note: The project they provided was already set up for PHP 8.5, so make sure your local environment can work with 8.5.

 Key Technical Notes:
Focus on OOP, code structure, and creating testable classes.
Important to handle functions that echo output, as this affects how tests must be written.
PHPUnit was already provided and configured in the solution.
All work was done locally.
